# Kickstart

My dev environment automated!

## Story

Got plenty tired of the never ending cycle of downloading, installing, configuring and customizing every piece of software I use on my machines throughout the years.

Always wanted to learn IT automation tools beyond my surface level knowledge.

My dev machines orchestrations seemed like a great excuse to try [**Ansible**](https://www.ansible.com).

## Running

**Obs**.: This script assumes **Arch Linux** and will break running on any other distro as it uses both pacman (Arch's package manager) and aur (Arch's User Repository for community packages) modules.

To setup the machine, just run the setup script:

    $ ./setup
